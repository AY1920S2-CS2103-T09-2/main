== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a customer).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== [Proposed] Undo/Redo feature
==== Proposed Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th customer in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new customer. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the customer was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the customer being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::managecustomer[]
=== Add delete/edit/clear/list/find customer feature
The manage product mechanism is facilitated by `InventorySystemParser`.
First, the InventorySystemParser class parses the user command.
This results in a Command object which is executed by the LogicManager.
The command execution modifies Model's customer list depending on the command.
The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a CommandResult object which is passed back to the Ui.

The following commands are available to be parsed by InventorySystemParser:

* `AddCustomerCommand` -- Adds a customer into the customer list in the inventory system.
* `ListCustomerCommand` -- Lists all customers in the customer list.
* `ClearCustomerCommand` -- Clears all customers in the customer list.
* `DeleteCustomerCommand` -- Deletes a customer from the customer list in the inventory system.
* `EditCustomerCommand` -- Edits a customer details (name, phone, email, address, tags)
* `FindCustomerCommand` -- Finds customer with name containing given keyword(s)

The commands all inherit from superclass `Command`. Only add, delete, edit and find commands require a command parser to parse the arguments entered by the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add operation works:

image::AddCustomerSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following sequence diagram shows how the list operation works:

image::ListCustomerSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following sequence diagram shows how the edit operation works:

image::EditCustomerSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a command that changes the product list in the model:

// end::managecustomer[]

// tag::manageproduct[]
=== [Proposed] Add/ delete/ edit/ clear/ list/ find product feature
==== Proposed Implementation

The manage product mechanism is facilitated by `InventorySystemParser`.
First, the InventorySystemParser class parses the user command.
This results in a Command object which is executed by the LogicManager.
The command execution modifies Model's product list depending on the command.
The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a CommandResult object which is passed back to the Ui.

The following commands are available to be parsed by InventorySystemParser:

* `AddProductCommand` -- Adds a product into the product list in the inventory system.
* `ListProductCommand` -- Lists all products in the product list.
* `ClearProductCommand` -- Clears all products in the product list.
* `DeleteProductCommand` -- Deletes a product from the product list in the inventory system.
* `EditProductCommand` -- Edits a product details (description, price, quantity, sales)
* `FindProductCommand` -- Finds products with name containing given keyword(s)

The commands all inherit from superclass `Command`. Only add, delete, edit and find commands require a command parser to parse the arguments entered by the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add operation works:

image::AddProductSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following sequence diagram shows how the list operation works:

image::ListProductSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following sequence diagram shows how the edit operation works:

image::EditProductSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a command that changes the product list in the model:

image::ProductActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How product commands are executed

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Keep products in the inventory system
** Pros: Easy to implement, use less memory
** Cons: If inventory system is corrupted then product data is lost
* **Alternative 2:** Keep products in a product management system, separate from the customers and transactions
** Pros: Keep implementation of products, customers and transactions separate
** Cons: Use more memory, tedious implementation

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the product commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list (`ArrayList`) to store the products
** Pros: Easy to sort and iterate through the list, get(index) method always gives an O(1) performance
** Cons: allows duplicates
* **Alternative 2:** Use a hashmap to store the products
** Pros: Finding a product is O(1), does not allow duplicate keys
** Cons: Difficult to sort and iterate through hashmap, get(key) can be O(1) in the best case and O(n) in the worst case.
// end::manageproduct[]

// tag::managetransaction[]
=== Add/ Edit/ Delete transactions
The user input is handled by the `MainWindow` class in Ui first, then passed to the `LogicManager` and parsed into
`AddTransactionCommand`, `EditTransactionCommand`, etc. Depending on the nature of each command, new transaction or
updated transaction will be added to a new index or existing index of the `UniqueTransactionList`, hosted by the
`InventorySystem` class. For the `deleteTransactionCommand`, a transaction will be dropped from the `internalList`.
Since the `quantity` and `sales` attribute will affect the same attributes of a product, the affiliated `product` will
also be edited. In the end, the `filteredTransactionList` of the system will be updated so that the user can view the change
accordingly. Three commands are implemented corresponding to these 3 operations in the logic module:

* `AddTransactionCommand` -- Adds a transaction into the system and update the the quantity and sales attribute
of the corresponding product.
* `EditTransactionCommand` -- Edit detials of a transaction. If `quantity` is changed, edit the affected product
as well.
* `DeleteTransactionCommand` -- Delete a transaction from the system and edit the affiliated product.

For each command, a parser is implemented to parse the input into arguments.

* `AddTransactionCommmandParser` -- Parse the add transaction input and generates `AddTransactionCommand`. +
* `EditTransactionCommandParser` -- Parse the edit transaction input and generates `EditTransactionCommand`. +
* `DeleteTransactionCommandParser` --Parse the delete transaction input and generates `DeleteTransactionCommand`. +

The following sequence diagram shows how each operation works.

image::AddTransactionSequenceDiagram.png[]
NOTE: The AddTransactionCommmandParser returns a transactionFacotry with `productIndex` and `customerIndex`, while a
transaction is only generated in AddTransactionCommand.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to store product & customer in transaction.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store the product/ customer instance as an attribute.
** Pros: Easy to construct a transaction and display product/ customer name.
** Cons: Easy to generate bugs while any of the instance is editted.
* **Alternative 2:** Store an unique id and name of the product/ customer.
** Pros: Do not need to update transaction while product is editted.

===== Aspect: How to change the quantity & sales attribute of product while edtting transactions.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** If quantity/ product is changed,
re-store the quantity & sales of the original product, check validation
(whether the product has that much inventory as required on transaction), and then
and update the quantity & sales of the new product.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Likely to generate bugs when the new quantity exceeds inventory, i.e. the edit operation is not valid.

* **Alternative 2:** If quantity/ product is changed, check validation first,
re-store the quantity & sales of the original product, and then
and update the quantity & sales of the new product.
** Pros: Straightforward logic, not likely to create bugs.
** Cons: Validation checking would be very complex.
