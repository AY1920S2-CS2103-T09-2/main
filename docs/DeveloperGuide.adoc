== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `deletep 1`.

.Component interactions for `deletep 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[ArchitectureSequenceDiagram,500,500]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[UiClassDiagram,1000,1000]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `CustomerListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[LogicClassDiagram,1000,1000]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `InventorySystemParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a customer).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("deletec 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deletec 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[DeleteSequenceDiagram,1000,1000]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[ModelClassDiagram,1000,1000]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Inventory System data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Customer>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Product>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Transaction>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Inventory System`, which `Customer` can reference. This would allow `Inventory System` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Customer` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[BetterModelClassDiagram,500,500]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[StorageClassDiagram,700,700]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Inventory System data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::manageitem[]
=== Add delete/edit/clear/list/find <<customer,customer>>/<<product,product>> feature
The manage product mechanism is facilitated by `InventorySystemParser`.
First, the InventorySystemParser class parses the user command.
This results in a Command object which is executed by the LogicManager.
The command execution modifies Model's customer list depending on the command.
The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a CommandResult object which is passed back to the Ui.

The following commands are available to be parsed by InventorySystemParser:

* `AddCustomerCommand/AddProductCommand`
- Adds the customer/product into the list in the inventory system.
* `ListCustomerCommand/ListProductCommand`
- Lists all customer/product in the list.
* `ClearCustomerCommand/ClearProductCommand`
- Clears all customer/product in the list.
* `DeleteCustomerCommand/DeleteProductCommand`
- Deletes the selected customer/product from the list in the inventory system.
* `EditCustomerCommand/EditProductCommand`
- Edits the customer/product details.
* `FindCustomerCommand/FindProductCommand`
- Finds customer/product with attributes containing given keyword(s).

The commands all inherit from superclass `Command`. Only add, delete, edit and find commands require a command parser to parse the arguments entered by the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add operation works:

image::AddItemSequenceDiagram.png[AddItemSequenceDiagram,1200,1000]

The following sequence diagram shows how the list operation works:

image::ListItemSequenceDiagram.png[ListItemSequenceDiagram,1200,1000]

The following sequence diagram shows how the edit operation works:

image::EditItemSequenceDiagram.png[EditItemSequenceDiagram,1200,1000]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a command that changes the customer/product list in the model:

image::CommandActivityDiagram.png[CommandActivityDiagram,500,500]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How commands are executed

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Keep customers/products in the inventory system
** Pros: Easy to implement, use less memory
** Cons: If inventory system is corrupted then the data is lost
* **Alternative 2:** Keep customers/products in individual management systems, separate each of the classes
** Pros: Keep implementation of products, customers and transactions separate
** Cons: Use more memory, tedious implementation

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list (`ArrayList`) to store the customers/products
** Pros: Easy to sort and iterate through the list, get(index) method always gives an O(1) performance
** Cons: allows duplicates
* **Alternative 2:** Use a hashmap to store the customers/products
** Pros: Find can be done in O(1), does not allow duplicate keys
** Cons: Difficult to sort and iterate through hashmap, get(key) can be O(1) in the best case and O(n) in the worst case.
// end::manageitem[]

// tag::managetransaction[]
=== Add/edit/delete <<transaction,transactions>>
The user input is handled by the `MainWindow` class in Ui first, then passed to the `LogicManager` and parsed into
`AddTransactionCommand`, `EditTransactionCommand`, etc. Depending on the nature of each command, new transaction or
updated transaction will be added to a new index or existing index of the `UniqueTransactionList`, hosted by the
`InventorySystem` class. For the `deleteTransactionCommand`, a transaction will be dropped from the `internalList`.
Since the `quantity` and `sales` attribute will affect the same attributes of a product, the affiliated `product` will
also be edited. In the end, the `filteredTransactionList` of the system will be updated so that the user can view the change
accordingly. Three commands are implemented corresponding to these 3 operations in the logic module:

* `AddTransactionCommand` -- Adds a transaction into the system and update the the quantity and sales attribute
of the corresponding product.
* `EditTransactionCommand` -- Edit detials of a transaction. If `quantity` is changed, edit the affected product
as well.
* `DeleteTransactionCommand` -- Delete a transaction from the system and edit the affiliated product.

For each command, a parser is implemented to parse the input into arguments.

* `AddTransactionCommmandParser` -- Parse the add transaction input and generates `AddTransactionCommand`. +
* `EditTransactionCommandParser` -- Parse the edit transaction input and generates `EditTransactionCommand`. +
* `DeleteTransactionCommandParser` --Parse the delete transaction input and generates `DeleteTransactionCommand`. +

The following sequence diagram shows how each operation works.

AddTransaction Operation:

image::AddTransactionSequenceDiagram.png[]
NOTE: The AddTransactionCommmandParser returns a transactionFacotry with `productIndex` and `customerIndex`, while a
transaction is only generated in AddTransactionCommand.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to store product & customer in transaction.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store the product/ customer instance as an attribute.
** Pros: Easy to construct a transaction and display product/ customer name.
** Cons: Easy to generate bugs while any of the instance is editted.
* **Alternative 2:** Store an unique id and name of the product/ customer.
** Pros: Do not need to update transaction while product is editted.

===== Aspect: How to change the quantity & sales attribute of product while editing transactions.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** If quantity/ product is changed,
re-store the quantity & sales of the original product, check validation
(whether the product has that much inventory as required on transaction), and then
and update the quantity & sales of the new product.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Likely to generate bugs when the new quantity exceeds inventory, i.e. the edit operation is not valid.

* **Alternative 2:** If quantity/ product is changed, check validation first,
re-store the quantity & sales of the original product, and then
and update the quantity & sales of the new product.
** Pros: Straightforward logic, not likely to create bugs.
** Cons: Validation checking would be very complex.
// end::managetransaction[]

// tag::getprofitrevenue[]
=== Get <<revenue,revenue>>/<<profit,profit>> feature
The manage product mechanism is facilitated by `InventorySystemParser`.
First, the InventorySystemParser class parses the user command.
Then the `RevenueCommandParser/ProfitCommandParser` parses the user input arguments into Command objects.
The resulting `RevenueCommand/ProfitCommand` is executed by the LogicManager.
The command execution calculates the revenue/profit depending on the command.
The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a CommandResult object which is passed back to the Ui.

The following commands are available to be parsed by InventorySystemParser:

* `RevenueCommand`
- Gets the revenue made in a selected period.
* `ProfitCommand`
- Gets the profit made in a selected period.

The commands all inherit from superclass `Command` and require command parsers to parse the user input arguments.

The following sequence diagram shows how the profit operation works:

image::ProfitSequenceDiagram.png[ProfitSequenceDiagram,1000,1000]
The revenue operation works in the same way as the profit operation.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How commands are executed

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Calculate revenue/profit only when needed
** Pros: Decreases coupling, easy to test
** Cons: Need to keep calculating if command is frequently used (increase time complexity especially if transaction list is long)
* **Alternative 2:** Keep track of revenue/profit in a singleton class
** Pros: No need to calculate when revenue/profit command is executed (instead, revenue/profit is updated whenever a transaction is added or edited)
** Cons: Hard to unit test, increase coupling
// end::getprofitrevenue[]

//tag::lowlimitfeature[]
=== Setting low limit threshold to receive notifications for products
The low limit mechanism is facilitated by `InventorySystemParser`.
First, the InventorySystemParser class parses the user command.
Then the `LowLimitCommandParser` parses the user input arguments into `LowLimitCommand` object.
The resulting `LowLimitCommand` is executed by the LogicManager.
The command execution sets the updated threshold for the chosen product.
The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a CommandResult object which is passed back to the Ui.

The command inherit from superclass `Command` and require command parser to parse the user input arguments.

The following sequence diagram shows how the low limit operation works:
image:LowLimitCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How the threshold field is being updated.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Separate low limit threshold command with edit product command
** Pros: Decreases coupling, easier to test.
** Cons: Additional command to edit the field of an product.
* **Alternative 2:** Integrate with existing edit product command
** Pros: Will reduce number of commands the user needs to use.
** Cons: Hard to unit test, increase coupling.
//end::lowlimitfeature[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
